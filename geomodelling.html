<h1>Geo Modelling</h1>
<div id="container">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Geo-Modelling is basically a depiction of the inherent processes taking place in the Earth surface as well as in the sub surface, mainly through static also with some dynamic models. It also essentially includes the processes and the means of various geological activities like seismic data acquisition, exploration & exploitation, process and mechanisms of the sub-surface methods etc. Generally it gives a broader perspective and the different aspects of their geological applications. Prize worth INR 10,000 to be won!
</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
Participating team need to make and present a static or dynamic model. Model should be innovative and should present a theme based design. Seismic data acquisition, exploration & exploitation, process and mechanisms of the sub-surface methods etc. can be selected as theme; or other theme can also be taken.
</p>
