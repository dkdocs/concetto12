This round is aimed at testing bot's speed and strength.
The objective of this round is to transfer certain cubes into an empty  pan of a weighing balance whose other pan is preoccupied with a fixed amount of weight. The cubes to be transferred will be scattered throughout the arena.  There will be hooks fixed on cubes to facilitate the lifting action. An electric switch is placed on the arena under  the target pan. After a certain amount of weight is transferred on the pan , the lowering of pan will result in  completion of circuit which will  in turn result in opening  of the gate,and will mark the completion of task. Refer figure for details of arena.

</p>
<h3 style="padding-left:80px">Rules</h3>

                  after 5 min.:- (3000*)-100n-400m-5t<br />
*subject to completion of task<br />
N= no. Of times bot touches boundary of arena<br />
M= no. Of time any obstacle is touched and/or bot is pulled by its wire.<br />
T= time left after completion of task in minutes.<br />
T = time consumed in seconds<br /><br />
