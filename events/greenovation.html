<div id="container">

<p>
For decades we have been ignoring Mother Nature in pursuit

for our own selfish needs, but now we are at the precipice and so

we have to change our way of doing things in order to ascertain our

continued existence. The need of the hour is to adopt sustainability,

both in order to solve the rising energy crisis and pollution and

for this awareness is required. Before taking any kind of action

planning is required and thus we invite the most intelligent minds to

create a way for our sustainable future.
<br /><br />
The event will be organised in two independent rounds:
</p>

<h2>Case Study Round</h2>
<p>
In this round students will have to

submit a solution on the given problem statement, and depending

on the innovation in their ideas and the feasibility of solution teams

would be qualified for the next round.
</p>

<h2>Presentation Round</h2>
<p>
In this round the students will be asked to suggest some methods on how to bring awareness

among the general public on the generation of energy using

renewable sources. They will also have to suggest ideas to

convince the people for efficient use of these energy sources.

Marks will be given in this stage on the basis of the uniqueness of

their ideas.
</p>

<h2>Final Result</h2>
<p>
The marks obtained in these two rounds will

be added up to give the final result. The best ideas may be sent to

JREDA and some science periodicals if found exceptional.
