<h1>MINE-ERVA</h1>
<div id="container">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Mining is the art of exploiting mineral deposits at a profit. With much of the low-lying fruit already picked with respect to global resources "Automation & Control" has become hottest buzz in this competitive era for the industries as they struggle to cope with spiralling labour costs and dwindling resources. However, the ability of such machines needs to be proven, their cost effectiveness, time limit and loading capacities to be made a certainty.</p>
<p>MINE-ERVA provides you the chance to induce your intelligence and managerial skills through real life prototype of working open cast mine. Here is the chance to be a part of technical series, gauge your analysis skills to the fullest and learn from the best in the field "THE SCHOOL OF MINES".</p>
<h2>Event Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mine-erva will provide a real prototype of working open cast mine (resemblance of which can be seen from the model shown below). This prototype will be same to an ideal open cast mine with all the specifications as are present in reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a highly specified mine design with Trench, Bench, Dumpers, Shovels, Dragline, Dozers, Pit, Loading stations, Dumping stations and others, all will be in working condition subjects to the problem, money (virtual), controls, path and working condition given to a participating team</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>First of all virtual `x' crore rupees will be allotted to all the teams. Then</p>
<ul>
<li><b>level 1</b><br />Basic questions on mining will be asked from participating team at the spot.Each wrong answer will lead to deduction of some money from the principal amount given to the team. Each team will enter the level 2 with the left money (virtual) in hand.
</li>
<li><b>level 2</b><br />
<ol>
<li>Mine will be provided to team. Team will have to buy some machinery from collection of 2 Dumpers & 2 Shovels. Maximum 3 purchases are allowed.</li>
<li>Team will have control over entire mine given. The team has to remove the overburden as well as extract the ore. The overburden and ore will be weighed. </li>
<li>Problems like rainfall, landslide, and bench failure may be added on the spot of play.</li>
<li>Finally the profit of each team will be calculated taking into account the overburden and ore extraction costs, selling price of the ore and the overall team performance during the event.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<ul>
<li>The participant students must be currently pursuing education (undergraduate or postgraduate) in a recognized institute. The participants may be asked to furnish the supporting documents to prove the fore mentioned criteria.</li>
<li>Only registered teams will be allowed to participate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each team will be charged Rs 50 as registration fee for the event.</li>
<li>Each team can contain a maximum of 4 participants. Students from different colleges can form <br />a single team.</li>
<li>A limited time will be given to all the teams for extraction of overburden and ore.</li>
<li>Once bought equipments cannot be exchanged.</li>
<li>Touching the machinery by hands during the game will reduce some amount remaining with team.</li>
<li>For production cycle you will be given money which will be summed in your principal amount.</li>
<li>Fall of machine from bench or path will be considered injury to it, and a fixed deduction will be done in amount.</li>
<li>Only Top 3 teams will get certificate of merit. However all other teams would get a certificate of participation.</li>
</ul>
