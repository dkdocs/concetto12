<h1>TECH-QUIZZARD</h1>
<div id="container">

<p><i>One's first step in wisdom is to question everything - and one's last is to come to terms with everything.</i></p>
<p><b>-George Christophe Lichtenberg (1742 - 1799)</b></p><br /><br />
<p>You think you are tech savvy... Do your nerves tickle as you gain any technical information..????<br />If it is so, here comes a platform to prove it.</p>
<p>Tech Quizzard comes up with 2 extremely difficult quizzing rounds, with questions covering all the sectors ranging<br /> from recent advances in technologies, famous personalities in this sector to their role in nation's economy and<br /> making our world a global village.</p>
<p>But just knowledge about technology  won't be the only thing you'll need. We make sure that your decision making<br /> capabilities, also come in play.</p>
<p>Mind you when I say these questions will test your quizzing skills to the deepest level and extract the quizzarding<br /> genius out of you..</p>
<br />
<p><h2>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRULES</h2></p>
<p>There will be two rounds (QUALIFYING ROUND and STAGE ROUND).</p>
<p><font size=5>Qualifing Round:</font></p>
<ol>
<li>A team must comprise of 2 members.</li>
<li>Each team will be provided a set of 45 questions divided into 3 genres. 30 minutes will be allotted<br /> to answer the questions.</li>
<li>Phonetically correct answers will be accepted - this is a test of your knowledge NOT spelling.</li>
<li>Best 2 genre scores are aggregated to determine the score of each team. Your lowest score will<br /> matter only in the event of tie.</li>
<li>In the event of a tie, the score you dropped from your lowest scoring genre will be taken into<br /> consideration. If there is still a tie, the person with the highest scoring paper in any genre will win. If<br /> there is still a tie the player whose next best score (from any category) is highest (and so on) will be<br /> deemed the winner.</li>
<li>Top 5 scoring teams qualify for the next round.</li>
<li>In case of any dispute, the decision of the EVENT ORGANISERS will be final.</li>
</ol>
<br />
<p><font size=5>Stage Round:</font></p>
<ol>
<li>This will consist of FOUR rounds.</li>
<li>First round will be direct Question Answer round.</li>
<li>Remaining three rounds will be based on the AUCTION system, for which each team will be given<br /> 100 Bid points (only once) at the starting of the STAGE round. Rules for which are as follows:</li>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of each round 5 objects will be introduced to the 5 teams.</li>
<li>Objects could be image, audio clip, video clip, movie posters etc. However all the objects of a<br /> round will be of same kind, e.g., second round may consist of 5 images to be auctioned among the<br /> teams.</li>
<li>At the end of every round the <b>BID</b> points for each team will be revised as:<br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNew Bid Points= Old Bid Points-Bid placed in the round</li>
<li>Minimum Bid allowed to be placed by any team will be <b>1 Bid point</b> to fetch an object.</li>
<li>Any team cannot place bid above point score held by it (<b>100 Bid points</b> in second round and <b>New<br /> Bid Point</b> in subsequent round).</li>
