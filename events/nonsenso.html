<h2>For those of us who have already tasted NONSENSO</h2>
<p>
Are you ready to tast the thrill of solving a Nonsenso problem?<br />
Waiting for the same passion and adernaline to flow through your blood while you solve a problem?<br />
Catering all such need of yours, NONSENSO-2 is back in town. So, buckle up, tighten your seat belts and be ready to experience the NONSENSO fever!
</p>

<h2>For the newcomers</h2>
<p>
Hasn't it been a long while since you've really used those grey cells of yours?<br /><br />

Haven't felt the kind of satisfaction you felt when you finally solved one of those extremely tough maths problems?<br /><br />

Or when you beat one of those Irodov questions?<br /><br />

I think we can help you there... 

Making no sense and having no sense are two entirely different concepts. <br />

Nonsenso: a sense in nonsense. It's nonsense until you learn to make sense out of it. NONSENSO is all about using your mind, relating the unrelated, and passion to solve unbelievable riddles. Riddles that boggle your mind and want you to think differently. GOOGLE may show you the path.<br />
But mind it, it's just a search engine. The search is yours. <br />
And believe me, it's gonna be an enjoyable one. Hints are cryptic, ways are hidden, and answers...just concatenate them all.<br />
If it's still nonsense, maybe you need some more sense!
