<h1>Junkyard Wars</h1>
<div id="container">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Seen it and haven't felt it? Yes, it's of course a natural feeling for
all you guys who have seen the all-famous junkyard wars on Discovery
and always cherished to be a part of it!<br />
Here is the platform for you to test your practical machining skills
and expertise!<br />
The participant teams are given access to a junkyard and the
facilities of the workshop, and are required to build a machine in a
given amount of time to perform a specific task!. However, this event
also requires a sound understanding of basic theoretical principles of
mechanical engineering and robotics!
</p>

<h2>Rounds</h2>
<p>
There will be a total of 3 rounds:
<h3>Round 1</h3>
It will have a quiz based upon basic Mechanical Engineering concepts.
This round is used to test the theoretical understanding of the
participants about the basics of mechanical engineering. Top 10 teams
will be selected for the 2nd round.
<h3>Round 2</h3>
The shortlisted participants will have to undergo an interview based
on workshop practices n basic mechanical processes. top 4or 6 teams will b selected for the
final round!
<h3>Round 3</h3>
In this round the selected teams will get a problem statement based on
that they have to make the working mechanism. For making it the teams
will get the full access to the ISM Workshop where they will get the
Junk and various tools like Lathe, Welding etc. Teams will have to
build their model within a day (within restricted slots only).The
teams would then perform the assigned task with their machines in the
arena.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
The instructions for the final round will be given at the time of the
event. The testing/winning criteria of the models would be provided
during the time of the event.<br />
The model should not leave anything behind during its entire mode of
operation in the arena i.e. any model disintegration in itself during
its motion will be disqualified or fined according to circumstances
Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be disqualified
from the competition automatically.<br />
The decision of the judges shall be treated as final and binding in
any circumstance.<br />
A team may consist of 4 to 5 participants<br />
The number of rounds and their contents are liable to change before
the event and the change will be informed to all who register
All rights are reserved with the COORDINATORS. They may or may not
disclose any information depending upon the information asked. They
can change any rule at any time according to the situation
