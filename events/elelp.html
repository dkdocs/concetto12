<p>May be, you didn't forget the entrance of Aamir Khan (Rancho) in the famous movie 3 Idiots, and the comment that follows from R. Madhavan (Farhan) is: " 8th Standard Physics. Humne padha tha, saale ne apply kiya". All of us had studied it, but he implemented it!. So, it's the time for you to apply circuitry on hardware.
</p>
<p>
ELELP brings before you the adventures of electricity through programming of electrical and electronics circuits.</p> 
<h3 align=center>"It is not a dangerous game of life but the voltage of knowledge".</h3>  
<p>
Circuits are present everywhere now-a-days, from small mobile charger to large industries, from light in deep mines to the solar energy absorber. Have you ever tried to find out what mystery is inside it and how to play with it!!!   we aim to introduce a basic understanding of simple  circuits through a fun and non-intimidating  event which  allows you  to  learn  through  engaging  in open-ended programming.
It is not the power-play but is play with power. Days are gone when you were forbidden to play with electricity. Here you will be in electricity arena.
Here's a chance to use your theoretical know-how to practically design an electrical circuit. And to solve and design some of these circuits will be a nice challenge and fun!!!

</p>
<h2>Rounds</h2>
<ol type=1>
<li>	Prelims: CIRMAGING <br />
        <br />
        The round sink you in the sea of basic electrical and electronics knowledge required to recognise any equipment and circuit. Equipment and 		 		components related to circuits will be projected over the white screen. Individual candidate have to identify the figure and write its 	    	standard names on the paper and if a question is there, then you have to write its answer.
 		IF YOU ARE VIRTUOSO, THEN COME WITH US AND BE THE REAL ELELPER 1.<br />
        <br />
 

<li>	Semi-finals: CIRSINING <br />
 		<br />
		Here comes a chance to check your adoration towards prompt circuit designing and ability to really construct different Logic Gate(s). If 
        you are quicker and consummate of techniques then the race continuous and you are standing in queue of ELELPER 2.<br />
        <br />
<li>	Finals: CIRLATRIKI<br />
		<br />
        The mind is brewing with tension when sees the circuitry. It's a call to the best circuit designer of the country to get together for a
        showdown and throw out your phobia. Here's a real chance for you to play with circuits. you will encounter  with the mystery and challenges        inside real circuitary.
