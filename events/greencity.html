<h1>Green City Modelling</h1>
<div id="container">

<p>
Imagine a socially just, culturally rich and ecologically restorative civilization.
</p>

<p>
Imagine what tomorrow might hold for humanity if we rise to meet the challenges of today.
</p>

<p>
<em>We invite the most talented and daring designers, planners, artists and animators to create a new global

imagination to envision a city capable of thriving through the centuries.</em>

	<li>The city must display residential, commercial and industrial areas, transportation systems, communication systems etc.

	<li>The contents of the city model may vary from model to model depending upon the concept and the
ideas involved.
</ol>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol>
	<li>In the first round participants will be required to draw the theoretical model of the GREEN city which
meets the environmental needs of tomorrow in the best possible way on a A-1 size chart.

	<li>Tutorials will be provided soon based on which you can build your model.

	<li>Demonstrate the green city infrastructure for overall ecological balance.

	<li>Innovative and technical ideas of the participants regarding the conservation of the natural resources
applicable to the society will be highly appreciated.

	<li>Briefly describe the idea of the project in the form of an abstract (word limit: 250 words).
