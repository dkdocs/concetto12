<h1>ASME Industrial Design Problem</h1>
<div id="container">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
By the Gnostic Zoroastrians, The sun was considered<br />
"The Archimagus, that noblest and most powerful agent of divine power who 'steps forth as
a Conqueror from the terrible Alborj to rule over the world which he enlightens from the throne of
Ormuzd."
</p>
<p>
Solar energy is genesis of all energy. Whether one like it or not, the solar energy will be the future.
The age of fossil fuels was a very short interlude in the history of humanity. Nuclear-fission now and
perhaps in a few decades fusion will have a significant role but for the long haul it will be solar.
</p>
<p>
India being a tropical country receives adequate solar radiations for 300 days, amounting to 3000
hours of sunshine equivalent to over 5,000 trillion kWh. Almost all regions receive 4-7 kWh of solar
radiation per sq mtrs with about 2,300-3200 sunshine hours/year, depending upon the location. In
order to make India a leader in solar development, it is imperative for us to harness this source of
energy.
</p>
<p>
Concetto 2012 brings you the event ASME-IDP, where participants have to solve an Industry problem
of designing a Solar Vapour Absorption Chiller with solar tracking system.
</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>
EPC TEX TECHNIKS PVT LTD, pioneer of developing Air Conditioning and heating system

using solar energy wants the competing team to Design a 10 ton capacity Solar Vapour Absorption
Chiller using LiBr as refrigerant with solar tracking system. (Solar tracking system is not compulsory
rather it depends upon team members.)
</p>
<p>
We are also looking for a prototype of approx. 1 ton capacity.
</p>
<h2>Judging Parameters</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Survey and Collection of Design Data</strong><br />
    The competing team need to present their solution based on literature survey and Data they
    have collected specific to problem. Source for collecting data must be genuine.
	<li><strong>Innovation and feasibility of Solution</strong><br />
    The competing team should provide a creative contribution for solving the problem. The
    proposed solution must be equipped with schematic diagram outlining it. The solution
    should be workable, acceptable to the potential user and technically an economically
    feasible.
	<li><strong>Modelling of solution</strong><br />
    The team should design individual components of chiller system for a full scale
    model. However if team is preparing prototype it must be scaled down. Any practical
    experimentation results done on laboratory scale will fetch marks for team.
	<li><strong>Quality of Presentation</strong><br />
    The team will be assessed on clarity of data and solutions presented with scaled down
    prototype. Team must use their creativity and imagination tools for presentation,
    participants must be able to convince strangers that you are a winning team.
</ul>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<ul>

	<li>Each team can have a maximum of two numbers.

	<h3>Round 1</h3>

    <li>Each team need to submit an abstract containing the brief of proposed solution.
    <li>Abstract should be a single document (.doc or pdf) file.
    <li>The abstract should not be more than 3 pages with font Microsoft Sans Serif size 11-12,
    otherwise team will be disqualified.
    <li>Photographs /Tables /Graphs are allowed within the 3 pages of document.
    <li>Abstract should be mailed by subject as asme_idp_(team name) before 27th September
    2012 to <code>asmeismu@ismu.ac.in</code>.
	<h3>Round 2</h3>

	<li>Teams will be shortlisted by our judges and they will be provided Online Mentors
	(Industry Professionals) to assist them in solution.

	<h3>Round 3</h3>
    <li>Each shortlisted teams will be invited to ISM Dhanbad for final presentation

	<h3>Format of Presentation</h3>
    <li>Each team will be given a time slot of 10 minutes to present their solution
    <li>This will be subsequently followed by a Q and A session for 5 minutes
    <li>The teams are advised to prepare their presentation in Microsoft PowerPoint.
    <li>Team needs to send their final round presentation to asmeism@ismu.ac.in on or before
    1st October 2012 for compatibility.
</ul>
