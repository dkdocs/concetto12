<h1>Transpose Techno</h1>
<div id="container">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Discover the technological principles of a device or an object through analysis of its structure, function, and operation and find out some practicality in the devices. This involves taking an object (a mechanical device or an electronic component), disassembling it, and analyzing its workings and its general use in detail along with a satisfactory circuit/block diagram accompanied by proper explanation.
</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>A team may consist of maximum of 3 members
<li>There will be 2 rounds<br />
   (a) Prelims<br />          (b) Final Battle
</ol>   
<ul> 
<li>Prelims</li>
It would consist of a Questionnaire (Objective / Subjective) consisting of two sections:
<br />
Section 1:
<br />
Question on topics related to 'Electronic Components', 'Knowledge of Circuit diagrams ' ,   'Working & Principle of simple objects' ,  'given component if replaced then what?' etc.
<br />
Section 2:
<br />
There will be some bonus questions (maximum 3) to get bonus marks but to get those the team will have to attempt all questions. Keep in mind that if you attempt section 2 then there will be negative marking in section 1 but no negative marking in section 2.
<br />
A maximum of 4 teams will qualify for the Final Battle Round.
<li>Final Battle</li> 
<ol>
<li>The participant will have to disassemble the given object to realize its circuit & explain its working along with a proper circuit/block diagram and its general use.
<li>In case of a tie, team consuming less time bears the advantage
<li> Use of unfair means may lead to disqualification at any stage
<li>Decision of Jury will be final under all circumstances
<li>The necessary tools for disassembling the object would be provided on the spot.
