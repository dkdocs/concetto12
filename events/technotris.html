<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
For most of us digital electronics is convenient, easy to use and gives results which are at least comprehendible. But there is also another world, namely analog. From mobile networks to speakers, the use of analog is indispensable. They operate your MacBook's and are present in your high performance vehicles. Every electronic device owes its operation to these magic rings known to us as circuits. Hence the need to master them in the current lightning paced electronic industry is important. This event gives you the opportunity to put your classroom learning on circuit designing into practical use with a blend of embedded electronics also included.

<h2>Rules and Regulations</h2>
<p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>	This event is for students currently persuing their education in a recognised institute.
<li>	A maximum of 3 participants can combine to form a team.
<li>	Students from different colleges can be part of the same team.
<li>	The competition will be held in two stages.
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Event Description</h2>
<ol> 
<li><font size="+2"> Stage 1 </font>
<ul>
<li>	There will be a quiz on the fundamentals of analog & digital electronics and Circuit Designing.
<li>	The quiz will comprises of questions on basic analog, digital devices like MOSFET etc. 
<li>	Based on the quiz, teams will be selected for the final round.
</ul>
<li><font size="+2"> Stage 2 </font>
<ul>
<li>	Here in the participants will try to perform software implementation of design problems from analog or digital ckt.
<li>	They will have to design the circuits based upon the problem statements given using softwares such as MULTI-SIM etc.
<li>	The teams will then be selected on the basis of correctness of the designs for the next round.
</ul>
<li><font size="+2"> Stage 3 </font>
<ul>
<li>	In this round, practical knowledge will be tested against time. 
<li>	The maximum no. of IC for any team will be specified.
<li>	The components to be used will be provided.
<li>	The teams have to make the actual circuits based on the problem statements given.
<li>	Some sample problem statements will be like designing a digital clock etc.
<li>	Extra Credit for minimizing the complexity of Ckt.
<li>	The decision of the organisers will be final and binding.
</ul>
