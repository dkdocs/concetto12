<h1>iDesign</h1>
<div id="container">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>iDesign is a web designing competition that tests your skills and creativity in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
<p>The competition has two rounds. The first round, or the Prelims will test you on the 3 basic skills of designing separately. People clearing the Prelims will appear in the Finals, which will be much more challenging.</p>

<h2>Things required in the competition</h2>
<p>You will need a laptop to appear for iDesign. You may carry empty sheets of paper for your rough work.</p>
<p><font size=5>Things not required</font><br />
You should not carry any pre-written code in the competition. All the libraries required will be provided to you.</p>

<h2>Prerequisite knowledge</h2>
<p>You must know the basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript(to qualify the prelims, at least).<br />To succeed in the Finals, your knowledge of AJAX, jQuery, Photoshop or any IDE like<br /> DreamWeaver will help you.</p>

<h2>The Prelims</h2>
<p>You will be assigned 3 different tasks to complete in 3 hours, based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript separately. You will have to code in Notepad. No other editing tool will be allowed in the prelims.</p>
<p>Points will be given based on the accuracy of the task you performed. Five teams, with the highest points will be competing in the finals. In case of a tie, the team with the 'better code' will be given preference.</p>
<p><font size=5>Task #1: Render the Drawing Board</font><br />
The first task will be based on pure HTML. You will be given a 'drawing' of a web page on paper. You simply will have to write that up in HTML.
</p>
<p><font size=5>Task #2: Do it with &lt;STYLE&gt;</font><br />
Stylesheets can change the complete look of your web page. In the second task, you will be given a pre-written HTML page, and a screenshot of what that page must look like after styling it with CSS. You will have to style it using only CSS.
</p>
<p><font size=5>Task #3: Script Happens</font><br />
The third task will be based on, you guessed it right, JavaScript. A pre-written JavaScript, full  of nice little errors, will be given to you for debugging. If this task bugs you a lot, always remember that script happens.
</p>

<h2>The Finals</h2>
<p>The final round will be a 4 hour round of designing. You will have to design a complete website based on the data given to you. You will be provided the jQuery library to help you code, and you can use any web development environment you like. A nice stock of images will be given to you to use in your website, but you can use any other images you like. The details of the website, will be provided to the winners of the Prelims.</p>
