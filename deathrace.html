<h2>Prelims</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Robot has always been a substitute for humans in harsh conditions. This event tests the strength of the robot, the operating skills of the participating operator. In this prelims round the robot has to reach the final destination by successfully crossing each hurdle which comes in its path. At a time two manually controlled bots undergo a race to prove their mettle. Here one robot can obstruct another robot by fair means (for eg: collisions, wire cutting is not allowed).<br />
This race consists of 3 phases:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Phase1:</li>
    Phase 1 consisting of the starting four hurdles. For completing phase 1 the bot will be awarded 150 points .for successfully overcoming the hurdles the bot will be awarded 10i points where i is the number of hurdle.
    <li>Phase2:</li>
   Phase 2 consist of the next four hurdles. For completing phase 2 the bot will be awarded 300 points. For successfully overcoming the hurdle the 			   bot will be awarded 20(i-4) points ,where i is the number of  hurdle.
   This phase consist hurdle 5,6,7,8.
	<li>Phase3:</li>
    Phase 3 consist of least four difficult hurdles which are on the bridge . for completing phase 3 the bot will be awarded 450 points. Here for 					    overcoming the hurdle the bot will be awarded 30(i-8) points , where i is the hurdle number. This phase consist hurdle 9,10,11,12.<br/>
 
    There are fire sprays attached to areas at various places. This should be kept in mind during the manufacturing (making) of robot. After the    completion of this race by one participant team, (50*t) points will be deducted from total where t is number of minutes taken by the team.  
</ol>
<h3>Rules and Regulations</h3>
<ul>
	<li>	A team can consist of maximum 4 members.
	<li>Bot must not exceed 300mm x 300mm x 300mm as l x b x h in dimensions at the starting of the match.
	<li>The weight of the robot must not exceed 10 kg.
	<li>The size of the robot will be checked at the start of the particular game.
	<li>The size of the robot can change during the course of the game.
	<li>There can only be one manual controller at a time. The wires must remain slack at all times during the Game.
	<li>Teams will be provided AC 220volts (Home supply) but no adopter or regulator will be provided, so teams must bring their own devices.
	<li>If the judges consider that a machine has a high risk of damaging or sullying the arena, they will not be permitted to run.
	<li>Nothing may be deposited on the arena and the robot must also not leave behind anything in its path.
	<li>Arena is divided by 3 intermediate checkpoints, each of which has to be crossed to gain points for the respective zone.
	<li>The obstacles' order of appearance is in organizers' hands and can be changed but the number of checkpoint would remain the same.
	<li>Timeout: If at any point, controller is needed to touch the robot during the run (like if the bot falls off or gets stuck somewhere), then 	the robot has to start over from the previous checkpoint.
	<li>In the end, the robot has to reach its respective finish zone.
	<li>Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be scraped from the competition automatically.
	<li>The machine will be checked for its safety before the race and will be discarded if found unsafe for other participants and spectators.

</ul>
<h2>Finals</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Players will experience stunning speeds, takedowns and getaways as they chase, battle, escape or bust the participants.
The pursuit bot has to reach the end point facing the 2 cop bots and by successfully crossing the hurdles that come along its path. There will be 2 teams acting as cop bots and 1 team enacting the pursuit bot. The cop bots have to obstruct and decelerate the pursuit bot so that the pursuit bot reaches the end point in maximum time.
MIGHT AND SPEED IS ALL IT TAKES…</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The surprise arena will consist of several challenging hurdles the bots will have to make their way through. 
	<li>There will be some shortcut paths exclusively for the cop bots. There will also be some bonus challenges for the pursuit bots which they can use to their advantage.
	<li>In the beginning of the event, only 1 cop bot and the pursuit bot will start the race.
	<li>The cop bot has to obstruct and decelerate the pursuit bot till a checkpoint. 
	<li>After the checkpoint, the 2nd cop bot will take over the role of obstructing and challenging the pursuit bot. 
	<li>The pursuit bot has to evade to the destination in the best possible time.

</ul>
<h3>Judging</h3>
<p>
The judging criterion of the game is based on the cumulative best time score factor which will be evaluated by the following formula:
<br />S = TP – (TC1 x 0.05) 
<br />TP= Time taken by the participant to complete the task as a pursuit bot
<br />Tc1 = Time taken by the same participant to perform the given task as cop bot 1
<br />S   = Time score factor
<br />*All times are in seconds.
<br />*The team with minimum Time Score Factor will be declared the winner.
</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Damage to arena will lead to disqualification.
	<li>The pursuit bot will strictly have to follow the path restrictions.
	<li>Only 3 human interventions are allowed for the bots enacting as pursuit and will levy a penalty of 5 seconds each.
	<li>No intervention allowed for cop bots.
	<li>The pursuit bots unable to move for 2 minutes will be declared busted.
	<li>The cop bots will have to wait to make their move in a race until the pursuit reaches the specified checkpoint.
	<li>A team can consist of maximum 4 members.
	<li>Bot must not exceed 300mm x 300mm x 300mm as l x b x h in dimensions at the starting of the match.
	<li>Teams will be provided AC 220volts (Home supply) but no adapter or regulator will be provided, so teams must bring their own devices.
	<li>There may be some hurdles which will be manually controlled by the team mates of cop bots.
	<li>In case the bots get damaged, they will be disqualified.
	<li>In case of any disputes, decision of the organisers will be final.
