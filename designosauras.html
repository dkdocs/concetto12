<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Tired of being a passive onlooker while other built masterpieces..?? Here's a chance to put your innovative ideas to practice, an event that will test your creativity and passion for engineering. Be ready to compete with best minds of the technical world.
</p>
<h2>Prelims</h2>
<p>
Include building a bridge that could sustain maximum load & minimum deflection.This will test your modelling skills & implement the best design into reality.
</p>
<h3>Rules and Regulations</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Maximum 4 members are allowed in a team. 
	<li>All the required materials will be provided on the spot participants are not allowed to bring any material from their side.
 	<li>Newspapers should not be fed to the cigarette boxes.
	<li>The time given to the participants will be 1.5 hours.
	<li>The top 5 teams will qualify for the advanced round.
	
</ol>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>
 Boxes, match sticks, thread, office pins, straws, glue, newspaper, ice-cream sticks, cutter 
*only limited material will be provided for the construction of bridge
Physical Specifications of the bridge are: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Height of deck ≥ 10 centimeter 
	<li>Span of bridge ≥ 50 centimeter 
	<li>Pier spacing ≥ 10 centimeter 
	<li>Width of deck ≥ 15 centimeter
</ul>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This round will check the dimensional specifications of individual  bridges regarding height of the deck, pier spacing, weight.
	<li>Dead loads will be applied and gradually increased on the weakest part of the bridge span until failure occurs.

</ul>
<h2>Advanced</h2>
<p>
And in the advanced round you have to create hurdles 
that would delay a ball for the maximum time while rolling down a slope which would be primarily made of cardboard or thermocol.
</p>
<h3>Rules And Regualations</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Identical cardboard bases will be provided to all the teams.
	<li>All the required materials will be provided on the spot.
	<li>Dimensions and inclination of the board will be revealed on the spot.
	<li> f the ball stucks on its way, then the time penalty will be "2n!" seconds, where n is the number of times the ball gets stucked.
	<li>The time given to the participants will be 3 hours.
	<li> ufficient time will be given for the POP and other materials to dry.

</ol>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>
Thermocol, Cardboard , POP (Plaster of Paris), clay , wood, Water, Cutter, Glue and other materials (to create hurdles).
