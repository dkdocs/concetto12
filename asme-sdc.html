<h1>ASME Student Design Competition</h1>
<div id="container">


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>" Only those who attempt the absurd will achieve the impossible" <br />
Innovation is widely viewed by industry as the cornerstone of competitiveness; therefore the ability to create solutions to the real world problems is a valuable skill. The ASME SDC (Student Design Competition) provides a platform for Students to present their solutions to a range of design problems. We all know the universal law of energy conservation and how their conversion to each other happens in theory but ASME SDC provides engineering students with an opportunity to work on a conceptual design based on energy conversion.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Participants have to design a mechanism that will convert the potential energy of one litre of water placed at one metre high platform into kinetic energy of the propelled object/bot through a series of conversions or single stage process. The event will be divided into two rounds and score of both the rounds will be considered in final result. The teams have to use the same mechanism and object for both the rounds.
</p>

<h2>FIRST ROUND</h2>

<ol type=1>
<li>	The arena will consists of straight lane of 6mX1m which will be followed by an          inclined path of 1metre height and same breadth at an angle of 20 degrees. <br />	
<li>	A mechanism has to be designed which forces an object to go farthest, using the potential energy of given water.<br />
<li>	Water will be provided through a funnel at 1 m height with zero initial velocity.<br />
<li>	The more distance the object covers, the more points it scores.<br />
<li>	If the ball crosses the entire arena, bonus points will be awarded.<br />
</ol>


<h2>SECOND ROUND (BOWLING)</h2>
<ol type=1>
<li>	The second round is based on the game of bowling.<br />
<li>	Water will be provided through a funnel at 1 m height with zero initial velocity.<br />
<li>	The bowling arena will have dimension 3mX1m. <br />
<li>	10 bowling pins will be placed at the end of platform.<br />
<li>	Points will be specified on the bowling pins.<br />
</ol>


<h2>SPECIFICATIONS OF THE ARENA</h2>
<h3>Round 1</h3>
<ol type=1>
<li>	Height of Platform : 1m<br />
<li>	Dimensions of Lane : 6m x 1m<br />
<li>	Height of incline : 1m, inclination 20°<br />

<h3>Round 2</h3>
<ol type=1>
<li>	Length of bowling lane : 3m <br />
<li>	Width of lane : 1m<br />

</ol>
<h3>RULES AND REGULATIONS</h3>
<ol type=1>
<li>	Each team can have a maximum of 4 members. <br />
<li>	Only 15 minutes will be given to the team for setting up the arrangement and for trials.<br />\
<li>	The competitors are encouraged to be creative in designing mechanism and the object to be moved. The mechanism should be instant single hand interaction at starting and no other human intervention is allowed.<br />
<li>	The dimensions of the object must not exceed 15cm x 15cm x 15cm.<br />
<li>	Each team will be given opportunities to conduct 2 launches in case of any mechanism breakdown. A subsequent attempt can be given if the object goes off track but with negative marking. Best of the two will be considered.<br />
<li>	In case of a tie in total score, deflection of the object from the central line in 1st round will be considered.<br />
<li>	Except the potential energy of given water, no other initial source of energy can be used i.e. the potential energy of water will be the only energy in transit during initial conversion. <br />
<li>	Except water, nothing will be provided by the organisers.<br />
<li>	Exceeding the dimension limits will result in disqualification of the participants.<br />
</ol>

<h2>SCORING</h2>
<h3>First Round</h3>
<ol type=1>
<li>	For crossing ath checkpoint, x=10*(a2)points will be awarded.<br />
<li>	•	If the object stops between say mth and (m+1)th checkpoint, y=2*m*n points will be awarded, where n =[(distance travelled in cm from checkpoint mth /10)],[]=Greatest integer function.<br />
<li>	•	Total score=x+y.<br />
<li>	•	Bonus points,(z):For climbing the incline per 10 cms, 30 points will be awarded. Bonus will be given if the object jumps off the incline.The total score considered of this round in the final score will be score considered in final evaluation=20% of(x+y+z).<br />
</ol>

<h3>Second Round</h3>

<a href="img/asme3.jpg" target="_new">

</a>
</center> 
<ol type=1>
<li>Score of first two attempts will be summed up and the next two attempts are conditional at the expense of 50% marks deduction in first round.<br />
<li>The points awarded will be based on the marks of the pins which fall, as shown in the figure.<br />
</ol>
