<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><i>
Pure mathematics is the world's best game.  It is more absorbing than chess, more of a gamble than poker, and lasts longer than Monopoly.  It's free.  It can be played anywhere - Archimedes did it in a bathtub.  ~Richard J. Trudeau, Dots and Lines</i>
</p>
<p>
For the first time Concetto brings online maths quiz and it's not going to be just numbers and puzzles but something that lets you discover the underlying beauty of 'the' MATHEMATHICS.  This  quiz tries  to pursue the most beautiful tradition of mathematics, by  teasing you with something very obvious but finally making you think about it for hours in the end.
</p>
<p>
You are required not just to find answers but provide a proof because Mathematics without proof is same as Indian cricket team without Sachin. So get ready to challenge your grey cells in this mysterious world of unrelenting challenges. We will try to minimize the domain of the questions as far as possible.
