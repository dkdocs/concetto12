<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Case study can be defined as a research strategy, an empirical inquiry that investigates a phenomenon within its real-life context.<br />
The case study involves studying actual business situations, written as an in-depth presentation of a company, its market, and its strategic decisions, in order to improve a manager's or a student's analytical ability. Cases typically investigate a contemporary issue in a real-life context. There are multiple issues to consider and many 'correct' or viable alternatives to the issues are presented.
