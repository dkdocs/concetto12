<h1>ANFIBIO ROBO</h1>
<div id="container">


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Anfibio Robo tests your robot's ability to travel on both land & water. Stay fast, stay afloat as you traverse around challenging courses & the title is yours. A test of simplicity & speed.May the best team win!
</p>

<h2>Prelims</h2>

<p>The robot will move from starting point to finishing point while passing through the obstacles such as:<br />
1.	Rotating side fins.<br />
2.	Ripple forming motor.<br />
3.	Water jets.<br />
Rank will be decided depending upon the time taken for completion of task.

<h2>Finals</h2><br />

<h3>1st half: It can be completed in 2 ways:</h3>
<ol type=1>
<li>	If you select the zigzag path then you have to make your way through it to finally reach the central plank. <br />
<li>	If you select the other path for traversing, i.e. the one that has buzzers to be hit on its way, then you have to firstly press the buzzer & then touch the other second buzzer within 10 seconds to open the overlying gate.<br />
</ol>

<p>
 After completing any one of the paths one has to climb on the bridge to enter in the second half.
</p>
<h3>
2nd half: It can also be completed in 2 ways:
</h3>
<ol type=1>
<li>	Here if you select the no-bridge road, then the obstacles that you're going to face are from the ripple forming motor and the side water jets.<br />
<li>	The second path is a bridge with the middle part executing to & fro movement, making contacts with both parts for 4 seconds each. If bot falls in the water, it will have to travel through the other path. Additional time of 20 sec will be added to the time. <br />
</ol>
<p>
After completing anyone of the paths, one has to press buzzer confirming the completion of task. Time taken will decide the winner.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol type=1>
<li>	A team must contain 4 members which maybe from same/different institutions.<br />
<li>	Any time not reaching at given time will be disqualified.<br />
<li>	Organiser's decision will be final.<br />
<li>	Organiser's reserve the right to make minor modifications to rules.<br />
</ol>


<h2>Machine Specifications</h2>
<ol type=1>
<li>	Robot cannot be constructed using readymade Lego kits or any readymade mechanism. But you can make use of readymade gear assemblies. Violating this clause will lead to the disqualification of the robot. Violation of this clause will be solely determined by the organisers.<br />

<li>	The robot must fit within a box of dimensions 30cm x 25cm x30cm (length x width x height)(sizes are exclusive of the lifting & joining mechanisms) at the beginning and end of the game. Refer to arena diagram for more clarifications on starting zone. The robot, when put in the arena at the start of the game should have the same size as checked with the dimension box above.<br />
<li>	Bot should be designed in a manner so that it can move both on surface as well as on water surface.<br />
<li>	Bot may be wired or wireless if wired connecting wire should be at least 10m, this restriction should be followed strictly. More than one team members can control the robot at a time; more than one control mechanisms can be used.<br />
<li>	If the robot uses an externally placed power supply, the dimensions of the power supply are not included in the size constraint. However, in case of an on board power supply, the robot along with the power supply should fit within the aforementioned dimensions.<br />
</ol>
<h3>Note</h3>
