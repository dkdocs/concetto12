<h1>ROBO KRIG</h1>
<div id="container">


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>" Ave imperator morituritesalutant!" <br />
</p><p align="right">("Those who are about to die salute you")</p>
<p>Flying blades, violent motors, metal trashing metal, steel trashing steel. Its all there, so come on over and unleash the robot within you . 
Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. This is a breathtaking event inculcating both analytic reasoning and testing of structural durability of both you and your bot. All you got to do is:<br /> 
Your bots will be fighting mono-e-mono (one will be fighting mono-e-mono and your bots will be doing your bidding "
The mightier the bot the better though a small bot may suffice, we all know all good things come in small packages so well you won't know until you try it out right? So big or small makes no difference as long as you try and give it your best shot. 
Action may not always bring happiness. But there is no happiness without action so well I ask of you this are you up for some action?<br />
Metal trashing metal steel trashing steel come on over unleash the robot within you.  
For those of you who have participated before and lost your confidence in winning well let me tell you this "People often say that motivation doesn't last. Well, neither does bathing - that's why we recommend it daily." So just give it a try who knows you may turn out a winner.
Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.

<h3>Round 3: "Do or Die"</h3>

<a href="img/robokrig3.jpg" target="_new"> <img src="img/robokrig3.jpg" width=275 /></a><br />
<li>	<b><i>Arena Description:</i></b>
Hazards can catch anyone out. They can be also used to your advantage by pushing your opponent into or over a hazard which cause damage. Some hazards are the end for a robot and makes you the winner if you manage to get your opponent into one of these (e.g. the pit). Below are details on the arena hazards. These are good tactics so use them well. All these hazards are dangerous and you must drive with care when near one because you may intend to push your opponent into a hazard, but you end up in their instead and it is goodbye to you! Take caution!
Note that some hazards are there to cause damage to a robot and immobilize the opposition and others are there only to cause damage to already immobilized and dead robots.

<li>	<b><i>The Pit of Oblivion:</i></b>Hit the pit release button(after 1 min of the game start) at the end of the arena with your robot and a siren will sound as the pit lowers and a hole in the arena is made. If you manage to push your opponent into this, there is no escape and you are crowned the winner as a puff of smoke fills the arena as the opponent is pushed into the pit.<br /> 
<li>	<b><i>Arena Flipper:</i></b>As the bot come on the flipper, it will just flip only in even comings. Also, when a robot is immobilized, it can be pushed on to the flipper. The audience shouts "Flip FlipFlip" as the powerful arena flipper pushes up, propelling the robot right across the arena. Great fun to watch!<br />
<li>	<b><i>Side Wall Dumble:</i></b>Push a robot on this rotating dumble. This is probably the hazard which causes the least damage to a robot. Sometimes, robots can become jammed underneath a dumbler and Rebot will have to push it free.<br />
<li>	<b><i>The Drop Zone:</i></b>it is an irregular surface area to slow down the speed of bot. Sometimes, it may be the end fora immobilized robot. Anopponent robot can push a robot on to the field. Then, the countdown by the audience gets start to eliminate the bot from arena. This may be the fall of any item. These can be car parts, cookers, washing machines, ocean buoys or bowling balls! Great entertainment!<br />
