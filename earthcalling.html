Earth Calling is the paper presentation event, an unparallel event enveloping the wide diversities of mining, geology, geophysics, energy & environmental sciences - a plinth to present your ideas, a platform to show off your skills, a place to learn and grow. Take a small, yet concise topic, present a paper with some inputs from your side and you would do a valuable contribution to the mining industry. We would only be more than eager to welcome you and your brilliant ideas.
