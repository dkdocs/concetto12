<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In order to receive a clear satellite picture/data, the dish must not only have a clear line-of-sight to the satellite, but also the correct vertical (elevation) and horizontal (azimuth) alignment. The vertical alignment is the dish angle of elevation, and refers to the angle at which the satellite's signals hit the earth's surface.  In the northern hemisphere, they are flat – about 15⁰, the farther south you go i.e. nearer to the equator, the steeper they become. On Sicily (Italy) they have an elevation angle of 45⁰ and right on the equator of 90⁰. Horizontal alignment refers to the position of a satellite relative to where you wish to receive the signal, and requires the dish to be turned towards the east or west according to the position of the dish until the satellite is pointed at. Thus, the elevation and azimuth angles vary depending in your location and satellite

<p>
Now, there is an entirely different procedure to calculate the actual 'angle'/'position' in which one should hold the satellite dish in.  This procedure requires the knowledge of the position of the satellite, relative to the position of the receiving dish from which the elevation and azimuth can be calculated. Since the objective of this project is to automate the alignment of the dish 'only', let us assume that the elevation and azimuth are known from a previous calculation/procedure.
</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
The aim of this project is to assemble the required hardware and compile a program to align the satellite dish as per the given inputs which are the vertical and horizontal angles (speaking in a more friendly language) of the satellite (elevation and azimuth respectively).
</p>
<p>
The user should kept informed of any ongoing process as such (relayed / displayed) via the user control station/panel through any kind of user interface (L.C.D/L.E.D display interface or any audio system, or through any other simple interfacing systems such as L.E.D/buzzer interface).
</p>
<h2>Rules and Regulations</h2>

<ul>
	<li>No more than 1(one) 8-bit microcontroller can be used in the entire design.
	<li>Participating teams can consist of no more than 5 members.
	<li>The participating teams are supposed to bring their own peripherals i.e. 2 motors of their choice (D.C /stepper/servo) and a display/audio interface.
	<li>The teams will be provided with development boards containing microcontroller and ports for the peripherals.
	<li>The entire task must be completed within the time limit.
	<li>Changes in rules, if any, will be highlighted on the website and notified via e-mail to the registered participants.
</ul>
<h2>Rounds</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In the first round, the abstract of the model must be mailed. The abstract must essentially contain the technical details (such as pin-outs) of the system and the flow chart of the program that is to be used.
	 <li>The abstract must include team name, college name, name of the participants, contact numbers and e-mail i.ds. of the participants. The block diagram of the implemented model must be present in the abstract.
	<li>The confirmation would be sent to the selected participants via e-mail.
	<li>In the final round, during the fest, the selected teams must produce the final model of the system "before" the specified finish time. No late entries will be entertained.
	<li>The implemented design will be judged on the basis of accuracy, compactness, speed, and effectiveness of the program used and ease of use.
	<li>At the time of final round, teams must have a hard copy of the details of the model to be produced before the judges.
