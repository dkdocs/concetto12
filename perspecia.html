<h1>Perspecia</h1>
<div id="container">

<p>Ever thought of displaying and manifesting your wisdom and brilliance in a big way? Ever thought big, acted big or performed in front of the big? First of its kind, the <strong>Directorare General of Mines Safety</strong> is providing a huge platform to showcase and spruce up your technical and managerial skills and solidify the lymphatic problems faced by leading industries and scientists. The event shall consist of some of the most appealing real life problems faced by industries and scientist which shall call upon students to put their technical knowledge and understanding to test. 
</p>
<p>
The Director General accompanied with other directors of DGMS will be present in the judging panel. Needless to mention, if the presentation seems impressive to the judging panel, it might attract direct sponsorship of the idea from the <strong>central government</strong>.</p>

<p>Perspicia provides just the perfect occasion to canvass some of the manoeuvring cases faced by present technology. Use your knack to construe real life situations and come up with pragmatic solutions. Come, participate and enkindle the concealed indigenous superiority within you because playing with giants will surely make you a giant.
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: The event is open to all disciplines and participation will not require any kind of registration fee. A certificate of appreciation shall be awarded by the DGMS itself to all those qualifying the second round. Winners shall receive handsome prize money. Details of the topics are available at <a href="http://www.concetto.co.in" target="_new">www.concetto.co.in</a>. The abstract should be submitted before 23<sup>rd</sup> September 2012 to <code>perspiciaconcetto12@gmail.com</code>.  Finals shall be held on 4<sup>th</sup> October, 2012.
</p>


<h2>Event Structure</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The event will be conducted in 2 phases
    	<ul>
            <li>1st Phase: - Online abstract submission.
            <li>2nd Phase: - Will be held at ISM Dhanbad during CONCETTO'12.
		</ul>
	<li>Abstract may consist of the following wherever relevant
    <ul>
        <li>Approach to problem.
        <li>Process: How to proceed
        <li>Economy: Cost evaluated.
        <li>Political: Land Evaluation, democratic value, etc.
        <li>Environmental Consideration.
        <li>Other relevant aspects.
    </ul>
    
	<li>Short listing will be done on the basis of abstract evaluation and short listed participants will be invited to ISM for 2nd phase.
	<li>2nd phase comprises of presentation (detailed description of the process used, cost evaluation and politics involved) followed by a question-answer round in the presence of other participants and judges. The winner will be declared on the cumulative evaluation of 1st and 2nd phase.
</ul>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Each team can contain a maximum of 3 participants. Students from different colleges and different disciplines can form a single team.
	<li>The abstract should not be longer than 250 words.
</ul>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
This is to inform you that the following issues and innovative concepts thereon may be considered for
deliberations during Perspicia:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Develop suitable and available material or composite to be pumped into mine voids which can
work as equivalent material as replacement of minerals mined out to keep strata and land on surface,
undisturbed.<br /><br />

Riders:<br />
	<ol type="a">
		<li>Fill material to be equal or more strength than the mineral bed/formation, to be mined out.
		<li>To be technically and economically viable.
		<li>Placement and setting on Real Time i.e. immediately after extraction and formation of voids.
	</ol>
	<li>Suitable system for "On-Line" Real Time Monitoring of CH4, CO, CO2 and O2 with temperature and
humidity using long electromagnetic waves, short waves, infra-red or any other system or device to
eliminate existing system which is based on spot detection using multiple sensors.

	<li>Customization of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) signals for use as communication (two-way)
medium through rocks.

	<ol type="i">
    	<li>Design and Development of wireless communication system to be used in UG mines from surface
without laying any cable or fixed readers/receivers.
		<li>Customization of GPS and RFID hybrid network to be used for tracking, fences and communication
system in UG mines.
	</ol>
	<li>Development of suitable technique to give advance warning of over-stressing or under-stressing of
rock mass in 3D.

	<li>Development of suitable scrubber curtain to:
	<ul>
		<li>Quench the flame of explosion
		<li>Eat away the noxious gases CO, CO2 and NO.
		<li>Provide 19% O2.
    </ul>
All the above events/process should trigger automatically on sensing explosion and actuation within
milliseconds.
	<li>System to extract heat energy from in-situ coal seam and generate electricity in the form of distributed
and aligned electric cell in coal seam which can be transmitted to surface through boreholes on a grid
pattern.

	<li>Economically and technically viable system or material to hold electricity extracted from sun or light for
long duration i.e. from 25 to 35 years for use.

	<li>Harnessing Wind Power and storage system for prolonged use.

	<li>Increase efficiency and life cycle of solar panels.

	<li>Application of Nano tube, fibre and cell for energy storage, transmission and use especially for coal
mining sector.
</ol>
